Self-portrait Character Generator

For this character generator, I programmed a self-portrait avator in pure CSS and added interactive abilities to the eyes, earrings, and shirt in p5.js. Accessing the classes from the HTML file enabled a color change to each of the individual elements once they are clicked on. 

The background-color element is built within the sketch file and can be clicked on and changed infinitely. 

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with manipulating document object model (DOM) elements and callback functions. 

In doing so, I learned a lot about how computers generally communicate with code. For example, although the purpose of a class selector is to group multiple elements into an identifiable group, the computer will only access and manipulate one element within a class selector at a time. I found that in JavaScript, a 'for loop' is needed to apply code throughout the entire group.

I also presumptually assumed that I could change the cursor style of the background similiarly to how I changed the cursor for the DOM elements when the mouse hovers. However, rather than using a styling factor, the result was developed from an 'if loop' instead.

All in all, this was a fun project to get challenged by. If there is anything I would do differenly next time, it'd be to do a bit more planning. Creating the character out of pure CSS was incredibly time consuming and I found in the end, it would have benefited me to sketch a lot of the elements in p5 instead. Especially the hair, which took the most time and effort for me to do, just like in real life!
